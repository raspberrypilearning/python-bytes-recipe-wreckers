# Mentor Notes: Recipe Wreckers

## Overview

This lesson builds on the basics of `print()` and f-strings by introducing:
- Print formatting using `sep=` and `end=`
- String case methods (`.title()`, `.lower()`)
- Pranking techniques with `.replace()`
- Visual enhancement with emoji

Learners take an existing recipe and gradually transform it into something easier to read, then secretly sabotage it for fun.

---

## What They Will Learn

- How to split long lines of code for readability
- How to use `sep='\n'` to add line breaks
- How to insert emoji as bullet points
- How to use `.title()` and `.lower()` for styling
- How to use `.replace()` for creative pranks

---

## Tips

- Encourage experimentation with emoji
- Learners should run code before and after each step to understand the impact
- Reinforce that `.replace()` doesn’t change the original string — it returns a new one

---

## Challenges

- Ensuring correct placement of `sep=`, especially when using emoji + newline
- Using `.replace()` safely without breaking strings
- Managing variable names consistently between tasks

---

## Extension Ideas

- Ask learners to write their own recipe and sabotage it
- Introduce `.count()` or `.find()` to inspect string contents
- Create a two-option prank menu using conditionals (if ready)
